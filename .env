# CosyVoice Environment Configuration
#
# This file is loaded by the Rust server on startup via dotenvy.
# Place any environment variables here that should be available to the server.
#
# NOTE: LD_LIBRARY_PATH is NOT loaded from here because the dynamic linker
# needs it BEFORE the Rust binary loads. It's set in rust/start-server.sh.
#
# IMPORTANT: CosyVoice3 (Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B) requires prompt_audio for ALL
# synthesis requests. There is no SFT mode with pre-trained speaker embeddings.

# Model directory (can be overridden via COSYVOICE_MODEL_DIR env var)
# COSYVOICE_MODEL_DIR=pretrained_models/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B

# Log level for the server (default: info)
# RUST_LOG=cosyvoice_server=debug
