# CosyVoice Environment Configuration
#
# This file is loaded by the Rust server on startup via dotenvy.
# The server will automatically re-exec through pixi if needed.
#
# IMPORTANT: The Rust server MUST be built with `pixi run cargo build --release`
# to ensure it links against the correct Python version (3.10 from pixi).
#
# CosyVoice3 (Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B) requires prompt_audio for ALL synthesis
# requests. There is no SFT mode with pre-trained speaker embeddings.

# Library path for libpython (required by PyO3)
# This is relative to project root - server will expand to absolute path
LD_LIBRARY_PATH_EXTRA=.pixi/envs/default/lib

# Conda/Pixi environment settings (required for Python to find packages)
CONDA_PREFIX=.pixi/envs/default
CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV=cosyvoice

# Model directory (can be overridden via COSYVOICE_MODEL_DIR env var)
# COSYVOICE_MODEL_DIR=pretrained_models/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B

# Log level for the server (default: info)
# RUST_LOG=cosyvoice_server=debug
